            <p> Hi guys! I'm SUKANYA</p>
            <img src="sukku.jpg" height="500" width="350" style="float: left" alt="SUKANYA IMAGE"/>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a dedicated B.Tech student. Currently pursuing my degree, I aim to leverage my
                skills and knowledge to secure a high-paid job in the tech industry. Throughout my academic journey, I have 
                honed my analytical abilities and developed a strong foundation in various technical domains. My commitment 
                to excellence is evident not only in my academic pursuits but also in my hobbies, which include travelling, 
                dancing, and reading books. As you explore my portfolio, you'll gain insights into my academic and extracurricular 
                achievements. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects and am open to collaboration 
                opportunities. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and
                potential employers.
                Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out for further discussion or collaboration.</p>
